# Templating with ERB

## Description

In this lab, you'll practice generating a simple site using ERB (Embedded Ruby). First, you'll create an index page by manually building up a string of html. Then, because that's a real pain in the butt, you'll use ERB to generate an html page each for about 25 movies.

## Instructions

### Movie Specs

Before anything, you're going to need to create a simple Movie class. Instances of this class will have some basic attributes (title, release date, director, and summary). The class itself will need to implement a method that parses through a text file and creates Movie instances based upon the data in that file.

### SiteGenerator Specs

#### #make_index!

You'll create a class, SiteGenerator, that is reponsible for, well, generating our site. You won't be jumping directly into using ERB right away, though. The first method you'll need to write is `make_index!`. This method will, based upon your Movie instances, generate an index page. (Note: You will have to pay very close attention to formatting!)

For this method, you will build up a string and manually write it to a file, `_site/index.html`. It's going to be difficult to match the formatting that the test expects, but you can do it!

#### #generate_pages!

At this point, you should probably be annoyed about that whole `make_index!` method. Building up a string like that is lame. So we aren't going to be doing that again. For the `generate_pages!` method, you'll want to create an ERB template (in `lib/templates/movie.html.erb`) and use it to generate a page for each Movie instance.

Remember that you'll need to pass your current `binding` as an argument to the `ERB#result` method like this:

```ruby
template.result(binding)
```

### Generate the Site!

Once you've passed all of the specs, your site generator should work. Run `bin/generate` from your command line and then `open _site/index.html` to check it out.
